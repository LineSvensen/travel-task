Though disheartening, we didn't let this incident overshadow the overall experience of our trip. Our weekend trip to Milano was a whirlwind of flavors, fashion, and unexpected adventures. From savoring gelato and Italian coffee to exploring the shopping scene at Primark, we immersed ourselves in the vibrant atmosphere of the city.

Despite this setback, our memories of Milano will forever be filled with the joy of indulging in Italian delights and the thrill of exploring a city known for its fashion and culture.</p>
